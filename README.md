To get started:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  
* Run `npm start` to launch the web server and go to `localhost:3000` to view the `index.html` page.

If you need to add more files for service, include them in the `/public` directory - feel free to create subdirectory for scripts, images as necessary.
